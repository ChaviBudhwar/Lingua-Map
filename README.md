## 🌍 Lingua Map  
This repository contains my project **Lingua Map**, a website built with **HTML** and **CSS** that gives information in English, Italian, French and Spanish about **Italy**, **Spain**, and **France**, including all their regions. It's an interactive way to explore each country through clickable maps and region-specific pages.

## 📂 What’s Inside:
  - HTML and CSS files for each country and its regions.
  - Clickable maps that link to separate region pages.
  - Organized structure by country and region.

## 📝 Pages and Features:
  - **Country Pages (Italy, Spain, France)**:  
    Each has a main page with a map that users can click to explore individual regions.

  - **Region Pages**:  
    Every region has its own page with basic information about Cuisine, National Symbols, and Famous Landmarks written in English and the country's language.

  - **Map Navigation**:  
    Maps are interactive — clicking on a region opens the correct page for that area.

## 🎨 Languages Used:
  - **HTML**: Used to create the structure and content of all the pages.
  - **CSS**: Used to style the pages and maps.

## 🎯 Why I Made This:
I created Lingua Map to practice my HTML and CSS skills, learn more about these European countries, and improve my language abilities. I chose it as my **capolavoro** because it's the first time I built something like a full website — not just a single page — and it’s based completely on my own idea. It brings together several things I enjoy and care about.

## 📝 P.S.:
Since there were a lot of pages to create (two for each region), and I had a deadline, I used **ChatGPT** to help with some of the repetitive coding tasks. This project helped me combine creativity with coding and languages, and it's a milestone in my learning journey!
The site still contains many bugs, issues that need fixing and improvements are necessary.
